1) to run this GUI, run "MATLAB_to_Arduino_GUI_driver.m" in MATLAB

2) to edit the GUI, run "guide" in MATLAB by typing "guide" as a command into the command window; then open up the "MATLAB_to_Arduino_GUI_driver.fig" file

3) the corresponding Arduino code that goes with this is called "MATLAB_to_Arduino1_0.ino".  
-It must be loaded onto an Arduino plugged into your computer, with the PPM signal from an RC Tx going into the Arduino digital Pin 2 (preferably though a 1k ~ 10k resistor), and the PPM ground going to one of the Arduino's GND pins.
