CODE DESCRIPTION:
BACKGROUND:
-This code uses Timer2 to create a more precise timer than micros().  Micros() updates only every 4us.  However, I want something that will update every 0.5us, and that's 
what this provides. 
-The downside is that it changes the behavior of PWM output (using analogWrite) on Pins 3 & 11.
-The upside is that I have managed to get a precise timer using the 8-bit Timer2, rather than the 16-bit Timer1, so that I can keep the Timer1 unmodified so I can continue
 to use the servo library as desired.  Note here that the servo library relies on the Atmega328 16-bit Timer1.  I have deciphered this by knowing that
 A) using the servo library at all disables PWM output on pins 9 & 10; see here: http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Servo
 and B) PWM on pins 9 & 10 is controlled by Timer1; see here: http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/TimerPWMCheatsheet
-Note: every now and then, but not very often, you will see that the value returned by get_T2_count or get_T2_micros is late by ~4us.  This is because Timer2 is only
 an 8-bit timer, so every 128us the overflow interrupt is called to increment the overflow counter, and stepping into and out of the interrupt takes 4~5us
 according to Nick Gammon. Source: Nick Gammon; "Interrupts" article; "How long does it take to execute an ISR?" section, found here: http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/?id=11488
IMPLEMENTATION:
-To use this code, simply copy this file (I have it named "Timer2_Counter.ino") into your directory (folder) where you are already working on a specific Arduino file.  
Next time you open up your main file you are working on, this code will automatically open up as an additional tab in the Arduino IDE.  
-I have tested this code ONLY on Arduinos using the Atmega328 microcontroller; more specifically, the Arduino Nano.

I heavily reference the 660 pg. Atmega328 datasheet, which can be found here:  http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-8271-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega48A-48PA-88A-88PA-168A-168PA-328-328P_datasheet.pdf

setup_T2();  //This function MUST be called before any of the other Timer2 functions will work.  This function will generally only be called one time in your setup() loop.
             //"setup_T2()" prepares Timer2 and speeds it up to provide greater precision than micros() can give.
get_T2_count();  //gets the counter from Timer 2. Returns the Timer2 counter value as an unsigned long.  Each count represents a time interval of 0.5us.
                 //note that the time returned WILL update even in Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs), so if you call this function in an ISR, and you want the time to be
                 //as close to possible as a certain event that occured which called the ISR you are in, make sure to call "get_T2_count()" first thing when you enter
                 //the ISR.
                 //Also, note that calling "get_T2_count()" is faster than calling "get_T2_micros()," and is therefore the preferable way to measure a time interval.
                 //For example: call "get_T2_count()" at the beginning of some event, then at the end.  Take the difference and divide it by 2 to get the time interval
                 //in microseconds.
get_T2_micros(); //returns the Timer2 microsecond time, with a precision of 0.5us, as a float.  This function is slower than calling "get_T2_count()," and therefore is not
                 //the preferred way of getting time.  It is better to get the time by calling "get_T2_count()" then dividing the value by 2.  By choosing whether or not
                 //you want to call "get_T2_count()" or "get_T2_micros()," you can decide if you need the extra precision of a float, or not, at the cost of having 
                 //slightly slower code.
reset_T2(); //resets the Timer2 counters back to 0.  Very useful if you want to count up from a specific moment in time, or obtain an "elapsed time."
revert_T2_to_normal(); //this function might also be called "unsetup_T2".  It simply returns Timer2 to its normal state that Arduino had it in prior to calling "setup_T2"
unsetup_T2(); //the exact same as "revert_T2_to_normal()"
T2_overflow_interrupt_off(); //turns off the Timer 2 overflow interrrupt so that you no longer interrupt your code every 128us in order to increment your overflow counter. 
                       //This may be desirable when you are no longer referencing the T2 counter or timer and want your main code to run a touch faster, but you don't want
                       //to call unsetup_T2() in order to change all of Timer2's settings back to default.
                       //Since an interrupt takes ~5us to execute, and my Timer2 will overflow every 128us, disabling the Timer2 overflow interrupt will prevent 
                       //you from losing that amount of time (~5us) every 128us.
                       //Source: Nick Gammon; "Interrupts" article; "How long does it take to execute an ISR?" section, found here: http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/?id=11488
                       //Note: If you diable the Timer 2 overflow interrupt but still call get_TC_count() or get_TC_micros() at least every 128us, you will notice no 
                       //difference in the counter, since calling get_TC_count() or get_TC_micros() also checks the interrupt flag and increments the overflow counter 
                       //automatically.  You have to wait > 128us before you see any missed overflow counts.
T2_overflow_interrupt_on(); //turns Timer 2's overflow interrupt back on, so that the overflow counter will start to increment again; see "T2_overflow_interrupt_off()"
                            //explanation for more details.
